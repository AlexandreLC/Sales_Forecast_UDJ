# Would you like to also start a web application on YOUR LOCAL COMPUTER once the report and slides are generated?
# Select start_webapp <- 1 ONLY if you run the case on your local computer
# NOTE: Running the web application on your LOCAL computer will open a new browser tab
# Otherwise, when running on a server the application will be automatically available
# through the ShinyApps directory

# 1: start application on LOCAL computer, 0: do not start it
# SELECT 0 if you are running the application on a server 
# (DEFAULT is 0).
